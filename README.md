# Stylophone

## What I learned
- using [Audio Track](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioTrack) to creat sound from a sine wave
- using [setOnTouchListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnTouchListener) to detect if the btn is pressed or released
- using [Full screen mode](https://developer.android.com/training/system-ui/immersive) and hiding system and navigation bars
- setting the app to be only in [landscape mode](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/browser/trusted/ScreenOrientation)
